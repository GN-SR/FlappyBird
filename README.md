## Features
- **Pixel-perfect Gameplay**: Fly the bird through pipes while avoiding collisions.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks and displays your current score.
- **Lightweight**: No external libraries requiredâ€”just plain Java.

---

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
- An IDE or text editor for Java (e.g., [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GN-SR/FlappyBird
   cd FlappyBird
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**
   Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files:

## Usage
1. **Start the Game**
2. 
    Run the game using the instructions above. A new window will open showing the game screen.

3. **Controls**

    -Press the Spacebar to make the bird jump.
    -Avoid the pipes and try to achieve the highest score possible.
   
3. **Restart**
    If you collide with a pipe or fall of the ground, the game ends. You can restart by pressing SpaceBar or closing and reopening the game.

## How It Works

   The game is built using basic Java features:

   -Graphics Rendering: Utilizes javax.swing and java.awt for rendering the game window, bird, and pipes.
   -Game Loop: A simple loop to update the game's state and redraw the screen at a consistent frame rate.
   -Collision Detection: Checks if the bird intersects with any pipes or the ground.
   -Scoring: Increments the score each time the bird successfully passes between a pair of pipes.
